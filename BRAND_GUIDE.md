## 11) Visual Design Instructions by Use Case

### Executive Overview
- Use high-level KPI tiles with clear labels and date ranges.
- Emphasize ROI and risk indicators with neutral color coding.
- Keep charts minimal: trend line + variance bands.

### Operations and Program Management
- Present workflow timelines and status chips (planned, active, blocked).
- Use data tables with row-level actions and audit trails.
- Favor dashboards with drill-down patterns over modal-heavy UI.

### Voice Agent Console
- Persistent mic state indicator and waveform visualization.
- Live transcript with speaker labels and time stamps.
- Barge-in and mute controls always visible.

### 3D/Visual Interaction Layer
- Idle and listening states should be subtle and non-distracting.
- Use consistent gesture cues for "listening," "processing," and "complete."
- Provide a fallback 2D UI for accessibility and low-bandwidth contexts.

### Compliance and Audit
- Add visible action summaries and confirmation steps.
- Provide downloadable logs and an audit trail view.
